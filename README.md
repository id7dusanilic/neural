# neural

Python framework for implementing and training neural networks.  
Tries to follow style of [pytorch](https://pytorch.org). With this in mind, this
framework is in no regard better then [pytorch](https://pytorch.org), but is created as
a demostration of underlying alghorithms used when creating and training neural networks.
